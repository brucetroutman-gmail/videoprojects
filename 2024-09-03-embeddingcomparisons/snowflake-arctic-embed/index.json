relevant, even amidst significant computing and data constraints. This paper introduces InkubaLM, a small language model with 0.4 billion parameters, which achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts and more extensive training data on tasks such as machine translation, question-answering, AfriMMLU, and the AfriXnli task. Notably, InkubaLM outperforms many larger models in sentiment analysis and demonstrates remarkable consistency across multiple languages. This work represents a pivotal advancement in challenging the conventional paradigm that effective language models must rely on substantial resources.

These models, characterized by billions of parameters, have set new benchmarks in tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and more sophisticated applications like creative writing and conversational AI. Notable examples include models like GPT-3 Brown et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib11)) and BERT Devlin et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib15)), which have influenced academic research and have seen extensive adoption across industries.

disadvantage. The main challenge is the scarcity of quality textual data, as LLMs require vast data to train effectively. This data is often fragmented, non-standardized, or non-existent for low-resource languages, and the absence of essential tools like part-of-speech taggers or annotated datasets limits progress. With its over 2,000 languages, Africa exemplifies this challenge, as many of these languages are underrepresented in digital resources and NLP research Nekoto et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib32)). Additionally, the computational resources required to train and deploy LLMs are frequently scarce in many African regions, limiting the ability of researchers and developers to leverage these powerful tools for use within their communities Orife et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib35)).\n\nDeveloping models that are easy to refine, fine-tune, explore, and deploy in cost-effective ways on limited hardware is essential.

models have made strides in bridging the language gap, more efforts are needed to create models that are not only efficient but also locally relevant. InkubaLM, which can move 250 times its weight, inspired by the strength and adaptability of the dung beetle, exemplifies this approach by offering a smaller yet powerful model designed to empower African communities. Accompanied by two datasets, InkubaLM represents a pioneering initiative to distribute the computational load and enable access to NLP tools such as Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Parts of Speech Tagging (POS), Question Answering, and Topic Classification for their languages.\n\nOur contributions are as follows: (1) we introduce InkubaLM, the first open-source small multilingual language model for African languages, and (2) we introduce the first instruction dataset for five NLP tasks in African languages. (3) we are also releasing the monolingual dataset used for

5 African languages to encourage further research on low-resource languages.\n\n2 Related Work\n--------------\n\n### 2.1 Low-resource Languages\n\nGiven the vast linguistic diversity and the scarcity of digital resources for many languages, particularly in Africa, researchers have been exploring various approaches to make LLMs more inclusive and effective for these languages.\n\nOne approach to addressing the challenges in low-resource settings involves multilingual models and cross-lingual transfer learning. Models like Multilingual BERT (mBERT) Devlin et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib15)), XLM-R Conneau et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib12)), and Llama 3 Dubey et al.

is scarce. However, the effectiveness of these models in truly low-resource languages remains limited due to the small amount of training data available for these languages.\n\nIn addition to general-purpose multilingual models Qin et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib37)), there has been a push toward developing specialized models tailored to specific low-resource languages Hedderich et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib22)). These models often utilize transfer learning techniques, where a pre-trained model on a high-resource language is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset from a low-resource language Nekoto et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib32)). This approach improves the model’s performance and reduces the computational resources required, making it more feasible for use in resource-constrained environments.\n\nDespite these advancements,

such as linguistic bias, model interpretability, and the ethical implications of deploying these models in diverse cultural contexts remain concerning. This paper focuses on developing a culturally aware, efficient, low-resource model that can operate effectively despite limited data and computational power.\n\n### 2.2 Small language models\n\nZhang et al. Zhang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib45)) introduced TinyLlama, a 1.1 billion parameter language model pre-trained on 1 trillion tokens. Despite its compact size, TinyLlama leverages techniques such as FlashAttention to deliver strong performance across various tasks, outperforming many models within its class. Building on this, the authors developed TinyLlama v1.1, which includes specialized versions of models tailored for math, code, and Chinese language tasks, showcasing improved results through a

et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib44)) marks a significant advancement in the quantization of large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit representations. This method drastically reduces computational and memory requirements, enabling the deployment of LLMs on devices with limited resources. Departing from traditional quantization techniques that use 4-bit or 8-bit compression, OneBit achieves an impressive compression ratio while maintaining a balanced trade-off between size reduction and model accuracy across various tasks.\n\nMoving towards resource-efficient training, Inheritune Sanyal et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib38)) develops smaller base language models by inheriting layers from a more extensive reference model and training on a significantly reduced dataset.

of the original dataset—the resulting model performed comparably to others trained on significantly larger datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in low-data regimes.\n\nFocusing on on-device processing, MobiLlama Thawakar et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib43)) is a 0.5 billion parameter small language model (SLM) optimized explicitly for resource-constrained devices. MobiLlama is designed for energy efficiency, low memory usage, and faster inference times, making it ideal for on-device applications. The researchers employed a parameter-sharing technique across transformer layers, enabling the model to retain high accuracy while minimizing training and deployment costs.

models (SLMs) in zero-shot text classification. Their research involved testing models ranging from 77M to 40B parameters across 15 diverse datasets. The results showed that these smaller models not only match but sometimes surpass the performance of their larger counterparts, creating an open-source repository documenting their methodologies.\n\nScaria et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib39)) investigated the capacity of small language models to learn, retain, and unlearn noise patterns. Their study involved models like Olmo 1B, Qwen1.5 1.8B, Gemma 2B, and Phi2 2.7B. It revealed that while these models could learn and even eliminate noise, their performance varied significantly depending on the type of noise introduced, particularly at the character level.\n\nZhu et al.

dialogues. Despite having only 2.7 billion parameters, LLaVA-Phi demonstrated commendable performance across benchmarks, including visual comprehension and reasoning tasks. The model opens new avenues for applications in time-sensitive environments and systems requiring real-time interaction, proving the potential of smaller language models in sophisticated tasks while maintaining greater resource efficiency.\n\nFor natural language processing tasks, Brei et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib10)) addressed the challenge of translating natural language into SPARQL queries using SLMs. Models such as BART and M2M100 were employed across datasets like QALD and CoyPu, achieving solid results in SPARQL translation, though T5 models struggled with accuracy.\n\nIn another approach to model efficiency, Song et al.

synthesis, Lemerle et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib26)) introduced the Small-E model, a compact language model enhanced with linear attention. Their work set a new benchmark in zero-shot voice cloning, demonstrating the strong capabilities of small models in this specialized area.\n\n### 2.3 LLMs for African languages\n\nRecent research on LLMs for African languages focuses on several key aspects: the creation of linguistic resources, the development of adapted models, and the improvement of the performance of LLMs for these languages.

Ogueji et al. Ogueji et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib33)) present a novel approach with AfriBERTa, a multilingual language model specifically trained on low-resource African languages, showing that “small data” approaches can outperform traditional models like mBERT and XLM-R without relying on high-resource languages. Building on the challenges of low-resource languages, Adejumobi et al. Joshua ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib24)) address the hallucination issues in LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5 turbo, when processing Yoruba by employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, significantly enhancing the models’ accuracy and cultural relevance.

respective target languages (i.e., if the label is ‘politics’, then for Swahili, we use the Swahili translation of ‘politics’; if we switch to Hausa, we use the Hausa translation of ‘politics’). We did not perform this mapping for tasks such as NER and POS, as the labels are language agnostic. After generating the instruction inputs and targets for each task and language, we merged them and added a ‘task’ column to make it easier to filter later. We split into ‘train’, ‘dev’ and ‘test’ sets. Across all languages, merging tasks, we created a training instruction dataset of 148M samples, a validation set of 65M samples, and a testing set of size 55M samples.

decoder-only lightweight African language model with a 0.4B parameter model trained from scratch with an autoregressive language modeling objective for these five African languages. During training, we also included English and French datasets due to their prevalence in many African regions and the tendency for natural African languages to code-mix.\n\nInkubaLM architecture and hyperparameters follow existing work Thawakar et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib43)), with a slight modification by introducing multilingual capability and implementing custom Flash Attention Dao et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib14)) to enhance efficiency. This technique allows us to optimize the utilization of the compute resources, resulting in improved performance and efficiency during the training and inference process.

\"Figure 2 ‣ 5 InkubaLM ‣ InkubaLM: A small language model for low-resource African languages\"), we compared the training dataset size used for models ranging from 0.4B up to 8B in terms of parameters. As shown in the Figure, our model is the smallest and has been trained using the least data from the compared models.\n\nThe environmental impact of training the InkubaLM-13B model was considered and measured using the machine learning impact calculator 777[https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute). The training process on 8 A100 NVIDIA GPUs over 16 days resulted in an estimated carbon emission of 53.76 kg of CO2 equivalent.

‣ 4 Dataset ‣ InkubaLM: A small language model for low-resource African languages\"); these tasks are created by combining task datasets from different open-source platforms. IrokoBench is a human-translated benchmark dataset that includes languages from various geographical regions of Africa. We use AfriXnli, a human-translated dataset for African languages from the English portion of XNLI Conneau et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17024v1#bib.bib13)), and AfriMMLU, a human-translated dataset for the African language from MMLU Hendrycks et al.

outperform the better models such as Gemma-7B or LLaMa 3-8B, InkubaLM-0.4B shows consistent performance across all languages, making it a reliable option for tasks involving African languages.\n\nThe
